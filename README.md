Use **Rester** just like **Spring Boot**, and easier!

/** View / */
@View()
class SimpleView {

  /** GET / */
  @GET()
  index() {
    return 'Hello, world!';
  }

}

/** Create a rester server. */
const rester = new Rester();
/** Bootstrap and listening on http://localhost:8080 */
rester.bootstrap();
```
